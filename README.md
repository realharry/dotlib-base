# dotbase
C# base library for .Net Core.

DotBase is a base class library in C#, primarily, for buidling UWP apps.
It was originally created as part of the common libraries for the UWP apps I was building for Windows 10,
and I am now in the process of open-sourcing some of them
in the hope that they might be useful for other UWP app developers.

Nuget package available on [Nuget Gallery](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DotCore.Base/):

    Install-Package DotCore.Base


_Note: This is for C# only, and it is not a cross-language Universal Windows Component library._
